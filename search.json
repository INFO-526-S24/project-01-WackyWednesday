The time Period covered in this dataset spans entire 2021 to 2022 Premier League season. The 2021–22 Premier League season marked the 30th anniversary of the Premier League, the foremost league for professional football clubs in England since its creation in 1992 and represented the 123rd season of the highest level of English football.\nVariables in this dataset includes teams, referee, and stats by home and away side such as fouls, shots, cards, and weekly rankings for the season. The dataset appears to be in a tabular format with 380 rows representing individual matches and 22 columns representing each variable Both categorical and numerical variables are included.\nThe description of each variable are:\n1. Date (character): The date when the match was played.\n2. HomeTeam (character): The home team.\n3. AwayTeam (character): The away team.\n4. FTHG (double): Full-time home goals.\n5. FTAG (double): Full-time away goals.\n6. FTR (character): Full-time result.\n7. HTHG (double): Half-time home goals.\n8. HTAG (double): Half-time away goals.\n9. HTR (character): Half-time result.\n10. Referee (character): Referee of the match.\n11. HS (double): Number of shots taken by the home team.\n12. AS (double): Number of shots taken by the away team.\n13. HST (double): Number of shots on target by the home team.\n14. AST (double): Number of shots on target by the away team.\n15. HF (double): Number of fouls by the home team.\n16. AF (double): Number of fouls by the away team.\n17. HC (double): Number of corners taken by the home team.\n18. AC (double): Number of corners taken by the away team.\n19. HY (double): Number of yellow cards received by the home team.\n20. AY (double): Number of yellow cards received by the away team.\n21. HR (double): Number of red cards received by the home team.\n22. AR (double): Number of red cards received by the away team.\nThis dataset is ideal for analytical projects aiming to understand football dynamics, player contributions, and team strategies throughout the season.\n\nReason for Choosing this Dataset:\nThis dataset, focused around one of the world’s most watched sports leagues - football, It offers clear details that hold substantial potential. Football matches are known for their blend of skill, strategy, and athleticism.Its analysed through this dataset, providing a unique opportunity to explore statistical fouls affecting game outcomes. From team discipline records to the effectiveness of shots on goal, the dataset covers a wide spectrum of factors. Its richness enables a thorough examination, making it a valuable resource for gaining insights into the multifaceted elements that shape football match results and outcomes.\nOn the other hand, it allows for a singular exploration into the interplay between in-game dynamics and overall success or failure. This analysis could prove invaluable to observers, coaches, and even players striving to enhance their tactical approaches.\nBy incorporating halftime data, the analysis gains additional depth, providing a fresh perspective on the dynamics within games. In Conclusion, this dataset offers a comprehensive view of the multifaceted elements contributing to the outcome of football matches. Its richness and depth make it a valuable resource for anyone seeking to gain insights into the complexities of the game, be it for strategic planning, performance improvement, or a deeper understanding of the sport’s intricacies.\nMake sure to load the data and use inline code for some of this information.\nText HERE.\n\n## Exploratory code HERE."

    "text": "Questions\n\nQuestion 1\nThe first topic we will explore is if being on the home or away team has a significant effect on the team’s performance. Our hypothesis is that the home team will have 1) more goals at both half-time and full-time and 2) more wins due to “home team advantage”, where it is thought that the hosting team has a significant advantage over the visiting team. This hypothesis will be explored and tested using the variables described in “Analysis plan”. The home team and away team advantage will also be analyzed using the full time results as well as goals."
