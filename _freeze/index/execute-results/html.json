Summarize for Total games won by Home and Away team. Summarize for Total goals scored by each team in Home and Away Conditions.*\n\n### Approach\n\n*Approach goes here; delete this text when done*\n\n*Question 1 (ii) By comparing the Full Time Result (FTR),Home Advantage, and the Away advantage combining all and summary is created with the help of Home_Advantage variable Where if the Result is \"H\" it will be added to home team victory otherwise it will be added to Away team victory. summarizing the output Bar plot for Total Games *\n*To find the total goals scored by individual team in home and away- Advantage summary is created and combined together to form a new Total goals variable. And Now with Home team, Total variable as aesthetic layers Bar plot is created side by side to interpret the outcome for all 20 teams*\n\n**\n\n### Analysis\n\n\n*Question 1 ii : As per the data_set, The home game winning advantage did not created impact in every games but only in some games whereas for the goal scored ratio in home and away match except few teams, majority of the team scored more goals in home than in away. *\n\n#### Correlation between half-time and full-time goals.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Create tibbles based on if the home or away team scored the goals.

Although this can be shown with a density plot or area plot, it is easier to see at precisely which penalty counts were more often toward or against each team. Since most games had no red cards given at all, and the maximum number of red cards given was only two, both red cards and yellow cards are plotted on the same facet. The distribution of fouls is much greater, as every single game had at least one foul given. The two team types are mapped to both color and shape for accessibility.\n\n### Analysis\n\n#### Penalties by Team\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nq2_soccer_pen <-

number of games by amount of penalties, there does not appear to be any major trends regarding a home-team bias when it comes to Cards. That said, there are a couple more instances of the home team receiving zero cards (both yellow and red) compared to the away team. The number of fouls does vary, however. The number of instances of a team with more fouls wavers, but generally there are more instances of very high foul counts (18+) for the away team. Interestingly, there is noticeably more instances of games in which the home team received a moderate number of fouls (from 11-13). In general, it also appears that the away team is right-skewed for the total number of fouls given, while the home team is left-skewed.\n\nThe average penalties by team are provided in the following summary table:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n# A tibble: 2 Ã— 4\n  Team  Fouls `Red Cards` `Yellow Cards`\n  <chr> <dbl>       <dbl>          <dbl>\n1 Away   10.2      0.0632           1.74\n2 Home   10.1      0.05             1.65\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBased on the overall averages, the away team on average receives a greater number of penalties per game. However, it is still by a relatively slim margin. The table is shown below in chart form to visualize how close these averages are:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/q2_ctf2_viz-1.png){fig-align='center'}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n### \n",
