Methods included creating visualizations and summary tables to compare home and away team performance and penalties across the entire season. Results indicate a strong correlation between half-time and full-time goals, with slightly higher predictability for home teams. Home-team advantage is evident in goal scoring but does not guarantee victory. Additionally, there's a difference in the most frequent number of fouls given to the home team compared to the away team. The card-to-foul ratio also appears to be higher for the away team. Overall, this study offers insights into Premier League dynamics and officiating tendencies.\n\n## Introduction\n\nThe dataset comes from [`TidyTuesday`](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday)'s 04 April 2023 post [\"Premier League Match Data 2021-2022\"](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2023/2023-04-04). It is derived from [Evan Gower](https://github.com/evangower)'s [Kaggle post](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/evangower/premier-league-match-data) of the same name.\n\nThe [Premier League](https://www.premierleague.com/) is the foremost league for professional football clubs in England since its creation in 1992. The time period covered in this dataset spans entire 2021 to 2022 Premier League season. The 2021â€“22 Premier League season marked the 30th anniversary of the league.\n\nVariables in this dataset includes teams, referee, and stats by home and away side such as fouls, shots, cards, and point totals. The dataset is in a tabular format with 380 rows representing individual matches and 22 columns representing each variable, described below. Both categorical and numerical variables are included.\n\nThe breakdown of each variable in the data set can be found in the [codebook](https://github.com/INFO-526-S24/project-01-WackyWednesday/blob/main/data/README.md) as well as the [project proposal](https://info-526-s24.github.io/project-01-WackyWednesday/proposal.html).\n\nIn our analysis we will be focusing on the following variables:\n\n-   `HomeTeam` (character): The home team.\n-   `AwayTeam` (character): The away team.\n-   `FTHG` (double): Full-time home goals.\n-   `FTAG` (double): Full-time away goals.\n-   `FTR` (character): Full-time result.\n-   `HTHG` (double): Half-time home goals.\n-   `HTAG` (double): Half-time away goals.\n-   `HTR` (character): Half-time result.\n-   `HF` (double): Number of fouls by the home team.\n-   `AF` (double): Number of fouls by the away team.\n-   `HY` (double): Number of yellow cards received by the home team.\n-   `AY` (double): Number of yellow cards received by the away team.\n-   `HR` (double): Number of red cards received by the home team.\n-   `AR` (double): Number of red cards received by the away team.\n\nThis dataset is ideal for analytical projects aiming to understand football dynamics and team strategies throughout the season.\n\n**Reason for Choosing this Dataset**\n\nWe chose this data set because it provides comprehensive statistics contributing to the outcome of football matches. Therefore, we can explore the interesting topic of the potential existence of bias against away teams in the English Premier League. The availability of data allows us to use variables such as shots on goal or create new variables such as calculating the ratio of yellow cards to fouls to answer this question of bias. Some members of the group are also quite passionate about soccer, which definitely convinced us to use this data set!\n\n## Question 1\n\n### Introduction\n\nFirst, we explore if a home-team advantage is present when assessing teams' performances. Here, we use goals as the main indicator of how well a team performs. One way we answer this question is by characterizing the relationship between goals scored at half-time (variables: `HTHG`, `HTAG`) and goals scored at the end of the match (variables: `FTHG`, `FTAG`) for both home and away teams through scatterplot and linear regression analysis. We wish to quantify how well goals at half-time predict goals at full-time in general as well as seeing if the strength of this relationship changes based on being on the home or away team. Then, we explore this question of home-team advantage using the Full Time Result variable (`FTR`) and creating a barplot of total goals per team (e.g., Arsenal, Liverpool, etc.) and if they were home or away. Our hypothesis is that the home team will score more goals and win more matches.\n\n**Question 1A**\n\nDo the number of goals at half-time determine the final outcome? Does this relationship change between home and away teams?\n\n**Question 1B**\n\nDoes home-team advantage play a major role in the final match outcome?\n\n### Approach\n\nPart A: The variables used to answer this question are half-time home goals (`HTHG`), full-time home goals (`FTHG`), half-time away goals (`HTAG`), and full-time away goals (`HTHG`). A scatterplot is created to quantify the correlation between goals at half-time and goals at full-time (end of match) and is color-coded based on home versus away teams. Linear regressions are performed separately for home team and away team data and correlation coefficients are reported. Scatterplot and linear regression analysis is chosen because they directly determine how strongly two variables are related to each other.\n\nPart B: Using the Full Time Result (`FTR`) variable, home advantage and away advantage are categorized into a new Home_Advantage variable. The advantage is determined through the number of wins of each team. If the Result is \"H\", it will be added to home team victory and is therefore counted as home team advantage. If not, it will be added to away team victory and is counted as away team advantage. This information is summarized in a bar plot for Total Games to find the total goals scored by individual team in home and away. An advantage summary is created and combined together to form a new Total goals variable. The Home team, Total variable is then used as an aesthetic layer and a bar plot is created side by side to interpret the outcome for all 20 teams.\n\n### Analysis\n\n#### Question 1A: Correlation between half-time and full-time goals.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#Create tibbles based on if the home or away team scored the goals.

In other words, goals at half-time is a strong indicator of how many goals will be scored at the end of the match. However, there is not a perfect one-to-one relationship between these variables. For example, there are some cases where there are 0 goals scored at half-time, but 4 or 5 goals are scored by the end of the match. This plot also shows that there is slightly higher correlation between half-time and full-time goals for the home team than the away team. However, this does not necessarily determine if there is a home-team advantage because more goals does not necessarily equate to more wins.\n\n#### Question 1B\n\nAs per the dataset, the home team winning advantage did not create impact in every game but only in some games. For the goals scored in home and away match, the majority of the teams scored more goals when playing as home rather than in away (with a few exceptions, such as Chelsea).\n\n## Question 2\n\n### Introduction\n\nIn question 2, we want to figure out what effect (if any) does being the \"home\" team versus being the \"away\" team affect the teams' penalties?\n\nA correlation matrix is first used to find any potential relationships amongst the variables of interest before any further analysis is conducted. The variables of interest here are red cards, yellow cards,the card foul ratio and the full time goals. The correlation plot is designed to assign a higher color hue to the variables which have a relatively higher correlation. From the visualization, it is revealed that the most positively correlated variables of interest are yellow cards and the card foul ratio. This is followed by the yellow cards and the number of fouls. All other variables of interest seem to have very little correlation amongst them.\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nsoccer_corr <- soccer |>\n  mutate(\n    HTFCR = (HR + HY)/ HF,\n    ATFCR = (AR + AY)/AF\n  ) |>\n  pivot_longer( cols = c( 'HF', 'AF'),\n                names_to = 'Team_Fouls',\n                values_to = 'Fouls') |>\n  pivot_longer( cols = c( 'HY', 'AY'),\n                names_to = 'Team_Yellows',\n                values_to = 'yellow_cards') |>\n  pivot_longer( cols = c( 'HR', 'AR'),\n                names_to = 'Team_Reds',\n                values_to = 'red_cards') |>\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c( 'HTFCR', 'ATFCR'),\n    names_to = 'Team',\n    values_to = 'CFR'\n  ) |>\n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c('FTHG', 'FTAG'),\n    names_to = 'TFTG', values_to = 'FTG'\n  )\n\nsoccer_corr <- soccer_corr |>\n  select( red_cards, yellow_cards, Fouls, CFR, FTG ) |>\n  rename( 'Red' = red_cards, 'Yellow' = yellow_cards )\n\ncor_matrix <- round(cor(soccer_corr) , 2)\n\nggcorrplot(cor_matrix,\n           hc.order = TRUE,\n           type = 'lower',\n           lab = TRUE) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(\n    legend.position = 'none',\n    panel.grid = element_blank(),\n    text = element_text(\n      face = \"bold\",\n      color = \"#3d195b\"\n    ),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    x = NULL,\n    y = NULL,\n    title = \"The correlation between the variables used for the analysis\",\n    subtitle = paste0(\"Card to Foul Ratio(CFR), Yellow cards(Yellow),\\n\",\n                      \"Red cards(Red), and Full Time Goals (FTG)\")\n  )\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/q2_corr_plot-1.png){fig-align='center' fig-alt='Correlation plot comparing variables relating to Premier League data variables of cards-to-foul ratio (CFR), yellow cards, red cards, and full-time goals (FTG).

Although this can be shown with a density plot or area plot, it is easier to see at precisely which penalty counts were more often toward or against each team. Since most games had no red cards given at all, and the maximum number of red cards given was only two, both red cards and yellow cards are plotted on the same facet. The distribution of fouls is much greater, as every single game had at least one foul given. The two team types are mapped to both color and shape for accessibility.\n\n#### Question 2B\n\nTo visualize the card foul ratio of the home and away team, a density plot was used. A density plot was chosen to facilitate the representation of the distribution of the home and away matches card foul ratio. A density plot in this context helps to view which team may have a higher card foul ratio and whether the card foul ratio is relatively higher or lower at certain point in the distribution. The aim of this plot is to visualize how aggressively the home or away teams play based on the card foul ratio information.\n\n### Analysis\n\n#### Question 2A: Penalties by Team\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nq2_soccer_pen <- soccer |> \n  select(HF, AF, HY, AY, HR, AR) |>\n  rename(\n    yellow_home = HY,\n    yellow_away = AY,\n    foul_home = HF,\n    foul_away = AF,\n    red_home = HR,\n    red_away = AR\n  ) |>\n  mutate(game_number = row_number()) |> \n  group_by(game_number) |> \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = c(yellow_home, red_home,\n             yellow_away, red_away,\n             foul_away, foul_home),\n    names_to = \"pen_type\",\n    values_to = \"pen_count\"\n  ) |> \n  mutate(\n    pen_cat = case_when(\n      str_detect(pen_type, \"yellow\") ~ \"yellow\",\n      str_detect(pen_type, \"red\") ~ \"red\",\n      str_detect(pen_type, \"foul\") ~ \"foul\"\n    ),\n    h_a = case_when(\n      str_detect(pen_type, \"home\") ~ \"Home\",\n      str_detect(pen_type, \"away\") ~ \"Away\"\n    )\n  ) |>\n  group_by(h_a, pen_count, pen_cat) |> \n  select(!pen_type) |> \n  summarize(tot = n()) |> \n  mutate(\n    pen_cf = case_when(\n      pen_cat == \"foul\" ~ \"Fouls\",\n      TRUE ~ \"Cards\"\n    )\n  )\n\nq2_penalties_viz <- ggplot(q2_soccer_pen,\n                           aes(x = pen_count,\n                               y = tot,\n                               group = pen_cat,\n                               color = h_a)) +\n  facet_wrap(~pen_cf,\n             ncol = 1,\n             scales = \"free\"\n             ) +\n  geom_line(\n    data = filter(q2_soccer_pen, pen_cat == \"red\"),\n    aes(group = interaction(pen_cat, h_a)),\n    lineend = \"round\",\n    linewidth = 10,\n    alpha = 0.05,\n    color = \"red\"\n  ) +\n  geom_line(\n    data = filter(q2_soccer_pen, pen_cat == \"yellow\"),\n    aes(group = interaction(pen_cat, h_a)),\n    lineend = \"round\",\n    linewidth = 10,\n    alpha = 0.1,\n    color = \"yellow\"\n  ) +\n  geom_line(\n    data = filter(q2_soccer_pen, pen_cat == \"foul\"),\n    aes(group = interaction(pen_cat, h_a)),\n    lineend = \"round\",\n    linewidth = 10,\n    alpha = 0.05,\n    color = \"purple\"\n  ) +\n  geom_line(\n    aes(group = interaction(pen_cat, h_a)),\n    linewidth = 1,\n    alpha = 0.5\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    aes(shape = h_a),\n    size = 4,\n    stroke = 1.5\n  ) +\n  geom_text(\n    data = data.frame(\n      \"label\" = c(\"Red Cards\", \"Yellow Cards\", \"Fouls\"),\n      x = c(1, 1.75, 4),\n      y = c(300, 170, 30),\n      pen_cf = c(\"Cards\", \"Cards\", \"Fouls\")\n    ),\n    aes(x = x, y = y, group = 1, label = label),\n    color = pal_pl_logo,\n    family = \"Poppins\",\n    fontface = \"bold\",\n    size = 5\n  ) +\n  scale_x_continuous(\n    breaks = scales::pretty_breaks(7)\n  ) +\n  scale_color_manual(\n    breaks = c(\"Home\", \"Away\"),\n    values = darken(pal_pl, 0.3)\n  ) +\n  scale_shape_manual(\n    breaks = c(\"Home\", \"Away\"),\n    values = c(5, 4)\n  ) +\n  theme_classic() +\n  theme(\n    text = element_text(\"Poppins\",\n                        face = \"bold\",\n                        color = pal_pl_logo,\n                        size = 15),\n    #legend.position = \"inside\",\n    #legend.position.inside = c(0.85, 0.85),\n    legend.box.background = element_rect(),\n    strip.background = element_blank(),\n    strip.text.x = element_blank(),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\"\n  ) +\n  labs(\n    color = \"Team\",\n    shape = \"Team\",\n    x = \"Total given in a game\",\n    y = \"Number of games\",\n    title = \"Number of English football games by amounts of penalties\",\n    subtitle = lab_pl_subtitle,\n    fill = \"Team\"\n  )\n\nq2_penalties_viz\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](index_files/figure-html/q2_penalties-1.png){fig-align='center' fig-alt='Point and line plot showing the number of Premier League games versus the number of certain penalties given in a game to the home team and away team, where penalties are divided by yellow cards, red cards, and fouls, and the team type is indicated by color and point shape.

That said, there are a couple more instances of the home team receiving zero cards (both yellow and red) compared to the away team. The number of fouls does vary, however. The number of instances of a team with more fouls wavers, but generally there are more instances of very high foul counts (18+) for the away team. Interestingly, there is noticeably more instances of games in which the home team received a moderate number of fouls (from 11-13). In general, it also appears that the away team is right-skewed for the total number of fouls given, while the home team is left-skewed. Interestingly the actual averages across the whole season are quite close, as demonstrated in the later \"Additional Information\" section.\n\n#### Question 2B\n\nThe density plot represents the distribution of the card foul ratio of the home and away teams of the data. The card foul ratio represents the number of cards (both yellow and red) given \"per\" fouls committed during a match. A higher card:foul ratio might suggest that a team may be playing more aggressively, while a lower card:foul ratio suggest the opposite. From this density plot, it is evident that the card:foul ratios of the away team are typically on the higher side compared to that of the home team. This could indicate that the away team feels the need to play more aggressively, or that there is a home-team bias when it comes to cards given.\n\n#### Additional information\n\nThe average penalties by team are provided in the following summary table:\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#make new Dataset\n# Selecting only the necessary columns \n\nCompare_dataset <- soccer[, c(\"HomeTeam\", \"AwayTeam\", \"HF\", \"HR\", \"HY\", \"AF\", \"AR\", \"AY\")]\n\n\nCompare_dataset$HCO = (Compare_dataset$HY + Compare_dataset$HR)/Compare_dataset$HF \n# Calculating Away Foul Ratio \nCompare_dataset$ACO = (Compare_dataset$AY + Compare_dataset$AR )/Compare_dataset$AF\n\n# Compare_dataset\n\n# Melt the dataset for plotting (tidyr pivot_longer is the newer alternative to gather) \n\nplot_data <- Compare_dataset %>% \n  pivot_longer(cols = c(HF, HR, HY, AF, AR, AY,HCO,ACO), names_to = \"Category\", values_to = \"Count\")%>%\n  mutate(Type = case_when( str_detect(Category, \"F\") ~ \"Fouls\", \n                           str_detect(Category, \"R\") ~ \"Red Cards\", \n                           str_detect(Category, \"Y\") ~ \"Yellow Cards\", \n                           str_detect(Category, \"C\")~\"Fouls Ratio\"), \n         Team = case_when( str_detect(Category, \"^H\") ~ \"Home\", \n                           str_detect(Category, \"^A\") ~ \"Away\" )) %>% \n  select(-Category) %>% \n  group_by(Type, Team) %>% \n  summarise(AverageCount = mean(Count, na.rm = TRUE)) \n\n# Summary table\nplot_data |>\n  pivot_wider(\n    names_from = Type,\n    values_from = AverageCount\n  )\n```\n:::\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n#|message: false\n#|warning: false\n\n\nreshaped_data <- plot_data |>\n  pivot_wider(\n    names_from = Type,\n    values_from = AverageCount\n  )\n\n# Print the reshaped data as a table\nreshaped_data |>\n  kable(\"html\") |>\n  kable_styling(full_width = FALSE)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n`````{=html}\n<table class=\"table\" style=\"width: auto !important; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\">\n <thead>\n  <tr>\n   <th style=\"text-align:left;\"> Team </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Fouls </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Fouls Ratio </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Red Cards </th>\n   <th style=\"text-align:right;\"> Yellow Cards </th>\n  </tr>\n </thead>\n<tbody>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Away </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 10.15789 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.1875560 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.0631579 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1.744737 </td>\n  </tr>\n  <tr>\n   <td style=\"text-align:left;\"> Home </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 10.05526 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.1750374 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 0.0500000 </td>\n   <td style=\"text-align:right;\"> 1.652632 </td>\n  </tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n\n`````\n:::\n:::\n\n\nBased on the overall averages, the away team on average receives a greater number of penalties per game.
