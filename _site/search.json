It is derived from Evan Gower’s Kaggle post of the same name.\nThe Premier League is the foremost league for professional football clubs in England since its creation in 1992. The time period covered in this dataset spans entire 2021 to 2022 Premier League season. The 2021–22 Premier League season marked the 30th anniversary of the league.\nVariables in this dataset includes teams, referee, and stats by home and away side such as fouls, shots, cards, and point totals.

    "text": "Questions\n\nQuestion 1\nWhat effect (if any) does being the “home” team versus being the “away” team affect the teams’ performances?\n\nIs there a “home-team” advantage, and does it have a significant effect on the teams’ performances, both at half-time and full-time?\nDo the team standings at half-time affect the final outcome?\n\nOur hypothesis is that the home team will have 1) more goals at both half-time and full-time, and 2) more wins due to “home team advantage”, where it is thought that the hosting team has a significant advantage over the visiting team. The home team and away team advantage will also be analyzed using the full-time results as well as goals. We also predict that the team ahead at half-time will win at full-time.\n\n\nQuestion 2\nWhat effect (if any) does being the “home” team versus being the “away” team affect the teams’ penalties?\n\nIs there a noticeable bias against the away team in terms of the number of fouls, red cards, and yellow cards received?\nHow do the ratios of cards to fouls differ between home and away teams?\n\nAlthough referees are supposed to be unbiased, we predict the number of fouls and cards against the home team will be less. Additionally, we predict that the home team will typically have a lower card to foul ratio than the away team (that is, will receive fewer cards per foul in a game)."
