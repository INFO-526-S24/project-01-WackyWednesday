Although this can be shown with a density plot or area plot, it is easier to see at precisely which penalty counts were more often toward or against each team. Since most games had no red cards given at all, and the maximum number of red cards given was only two, both red cards and yellow cards are plotted on the same facet. The distribution of fouls is much greater, as every single game had at least one foul given. The two team types are mapped to both color and shape for accessibility.\n\n\nAnalysis\n\nPenalties by Team\n\nq2_soccer_pen &lt;- soccer |&gt; \n  select(HF, AF, HY, AY, HR, AR) |&gt;\n  rename(\n    yellow_home = HY,\n    yellow_away = AY,\n    foul_home = HF,\n    foul_away = AF,\n    red_home = HR,\n    red_away = AR\n  ) |&gt;\n  mutate(game_number = row_number()) |&gt;

delete this text when done\nFrom the chart of the number of games by amount of penalties, there does not appear to be any major trends regarding a home-team bias when it comes to Cards. That said, there are a couple more instances of the home team receiving zero cards (both yellow and red) compared to the away team. The number of fouls does vary, however. The number of instances of a team with more fouls wavers, but generally there are more instances of very high foul counts (18+) for the away team. Interestingly, there is noticeably more instances of games in which the home team received a moderate number of fouls (from 11-13). In general, it also appears that the away team is right-skewed for the total number of fouls given, while the home team is left-skewed.\nThe average penalties by team are provided in the following summary table:\n\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 4\n  Team  Fouls `Red Cards` `Yellow Cards`\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;       &lt;dbl&gt;          &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Away   10.2      0.0632           1.74\n2 Home   10.1      0.05             1.65\n\n\nBased on the overall averages, the away team on average receives a greater number of penalties per game. However, it is still by a relatively slim margin. The table is shown below in chart form to visualize how close these averages are:"

Therefore, we can explore the interesting topic of the potential existence of bias against away teams in the English Premier League. The availability of data allows us to use variables such as shots on goal or create new variables such as calculating the ratio of yellow cards to fouls to answer this question of bias. Some members of the group are also quite passionate about soccer, which definitely convinced us to use this data set!"

Therefore, we can explore the interesting topic of the potential existence of bias against away teams in the English Premier League. The availability of data allows us to use variables such as shots on goal or create new variables such as calculating the ratio of yellow cards to fouls to answer this question of bias. Some members of the group are also quite passionate about soccer, which definitely convinced us to use this data set!"

    "text": "Questions\n\nQuestion 1\nWhat effect (if any) does being the “home” team versus being the “away” team affect the teams’ performances?\n\nDo the number of goals at half-time determine the final outcome?\n?\n\nOur hypothesis is that the home team will have 1) more goals at both half-time and full-time, and 2) more wins due to “home team advantage”, where it is thought that the hosting team has a significant advantage over the visiting team. The home team and away team advantage will also be analyzed using the full-time results as well as goals. We also predict that the team ahead at half-time will win at full-time.\n\n\nQuestion 2\nWhat effect (if any) does being the “home” team versus being the “away” team affect the teams’ penalties?\n\nIs there a noticeable bias against the away team in terms of the number of fouls, red cards, and yellow cards received?\nHow do the ratios of cards to fouls differ between home and away teams?\n\nAlthough referees are supposed to be unbiased, we predict the number of fouls and cards against the home team will be less. Additionally, we predict that the home team will typically have a lower card to foul ratio than the away team (that is, will receive fewer cards per foul in a game)."
